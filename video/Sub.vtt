1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Construction then melt everything he did research

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.100
builds investigating the Technical University Eindhoven arno pronk

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.220
years diligently and people he's cultures regard him we can not

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.340
without the beauty of ephemeral art today he is our optimist

5
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.890
yes very much more arno pronk he led the last four year project which

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.220
huge he urges further built where the

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
a fascination for construction with snow and ice

8
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.509
nja and is more mixed research that has to do with the construction of

9
00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.420
flexible silly and one of the men is true inflatable membranes

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.590
play pools

11
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.940
and no I can so you can with different materials

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.970
application include the sidecar concrete or composite or glass

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.220
yes emmen but demanding course that is compared with concrete or glass

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.190
typically clear as it reached

15
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.390
Well yes that's right Russian melting again that perhaps the

16
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.380
realists and one side benefit of the Brussels can share the

17
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.120
benefits

18
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.480
the advantage is that the melt and that nothing remains for you to

19
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.090
endlessly experiment and the second is a very cheap trick temperatures between

20
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.850
TURIN available and it has an impact, I went on the boards

21
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.920
the downside is that signal h may not be well enjoy yourself then you

22
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.509
equally beautiful tower put down as culture and then name you look out for

23
00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.180
your eyes

24
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.390
jaja after fast and hot too so many people ask why are you doing this now

25
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.300
and exactly what is the answer

26
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.210
but the answer is actually that of the year for me, especially as

27
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.510
teacher very important to check things out together with researchers from you

28
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.860
Search and find out

29
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.830
ice creams and particularly in a complex material with many hearing all her

30
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.880
carriage, and structural properties

31
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.950
and it is also charging a very complex for us to get to a

32
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.600
beautiful challenge this again in a sense not only a work of art

33
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.890
Research is also going to look at than

34
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.979
yes yes a year so there is actually quite good surveys and diamond

35
00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.380
For applications you can bring the ball they can for themselves festivals

36
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.960
we actually use that much if not compass

37
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.330
we also go back to the emmen spikes go this year to less

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.240
labor largest ice festival in the world is hanging in china agadir

39
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.749
NYS in the north north east of china

40
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.569
and that he is a festival house prices and the italian

41
00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.169
sundaes scattering wijhe

42
00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:19.779
9 as they build an ice castle complete jaco all solid

43
00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.340
blocks, however, for which purpose

44
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.700
for pulling the less each year one million tourists

45
00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.639
which so yes curing come to see ice sculptures which really has a

46
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.959
put himself down as a thin ice city in the world and there is the slogan used

47
00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.289
altogether with that subject

48
00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:41.019
anaheim and the first step of ten million inhabitants metropolis says

49
00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.510
and every year a million people come down there on yes and coming so watch

50
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.029
to include a tower and the requirement that you go behind

51
00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.359
drop in my

52
00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.799
year they do this for thirty years and

53
00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.209
but they build with chunks of ice we get there from the river to his

54
00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.989
massive blocks the stable on

55
00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.429
because we do is work with men so you also in the camps

56
00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:05.929
and there yes that US and they wanted something different and came after thirty years

57
00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.479
in contact with humans are forgotten very interesting

58
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.409
have in recent years and a small pearl done and the next year

59
00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.860
we go for a try drop a large tower for why

60
00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.999
then he must choir as high as actually had this afternoon was club you will thus

61
00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.219
prove

62
00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.619
You should be later that he had the country thirty meters are c30

63
00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.790
Peeters and in the apartment of three floors

64
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.899
ICE requirements

65
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:32.989
update yet in the target

66
00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.060
Well because it enables us to show what you can technically say so because

67
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.130
that it is possible

68
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.500
a random compare with the Eiffel Tower, we are prohibited in

69
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.829
put down Euroleague

70
00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.469
because here because we wanted to show what you can do with the steel in Huy

71
00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.189
can connect and ran, and that was the tone at the world so and so

72
00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.189
we actually want nokia show them with ice water what is possible to

73
00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.069
own tower still stands

74
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.769
it takes not so then again you can start again the year is

75
00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.269
However optimistic

76
00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.129
yes Rutte reported that circulate an enormous ice gate to the cathedral their

77
00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.209
doping requirements

78
00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.649
DEA would cultivate the ice that you can not put

79
00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.738
Well why do RTV Drenthe long trip buy is actually in 2022 and found

80
00:04:18.738 --> 00:04:22.029
the Winter Olympics places I sing

81
00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.279
and then also have a left-wing hobby horses their fins will very much

82
00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.800
requirements

83
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.310
years they would love thereby tent and dutch pavilion built for

84
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.409
I think it would be a young team and the interest rate target may be there are almost as

85
00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.599
Also it is thought very much and i mars missions

86
00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.580
only NASA has all competitions about written for

87
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.509
Charles how to deal with housing

88
00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.120
and the demand is there were options make way yes

89
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.840
after the sky is the limit literally in this case I want, I want you

90
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.539
Invite a sit behind the pulpit

91
00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.569
there's so I think I can about my snowman but can be much better

92
00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.569
because they all go to our optimist today arno koek

93
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.490
just look beyond the requirement is quite fascinating particularly nadja

94
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.080
structural properties

95
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.180
The students from Netherlands and Belgium have the greatest surge

96
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.569
thirty meters

97
00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.300
and reduced the highest tower of 21 meters in ice

98
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.779
many people ask

99
00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.050
what what is the point of this requirement constructions

100
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.810
there are many people with enough and you just power and money that technical

101
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.639
inventions in some way to

102
00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.199
exploiting and and those technical inventions

103
00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.249
the world would have

104
00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.249
and this has huge respect

105
00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.759
Unfortunately, there are examples of the idealists

106
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.379
ending when the final fill bags or a dictator or

107
00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.689
criminal

108
00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.029
in lead also is much more important to look at yourself

109
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.599
only which is good to do good

110
00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.360
by working on yourself, you can become a better person and a piece

111
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.279
closer to your soul come our soul is very

112
00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.039
emmen ultimately everything else temporarily

113
00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.279
in symbol of that temporary travel

114
00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.579
temporality is the oak thijs constructions that we go this year

115
00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:09.719
Building in China

116
00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.969
working on a complex project with an international team of researchers

117
00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:14.779
students

118
00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.839
there is a social and cultural and technological challenge

119
00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.469
while the ice is less expensive but environmentally friendly material that does not

120
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.099
leaving traces

121
00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.339
as we were eighteen 87 built the Eiffel Tower to show what

122
00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:34.209
it was possible to steel so we now show what you can do with water in the

123
00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:35.569
shape of the ice-cream

124
00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.219
but involves us not only that goal

125
00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.519
so for us the process is more important than it is it's the point of all that

126
00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:43.110
work

127
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.460
what is the point of all the work

128
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.199
it is a sign of our technical ability

129
00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.819
constructive beauty and impermanence

130
00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.789
but especially the little team work where students get the chance

131
00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.139
to develop

132
00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.569
better than that I can not make it

133
00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.770
and you do not really nice but that is not made by the drink

134
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.419
arno pronk our optimists and today all the optimism back

135
00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.229
win decision EénVandaag a radio also on twitter and facebook youtube

136
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.490
channel EénVandaag

137
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.810
I got you an optimist mail to radio and EenVandaag points

138
00:07:14.810 --> 00:00:00.000
help out
